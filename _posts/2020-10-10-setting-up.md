I have attempted a couple of times to start blogging with little success. This time I went for absolute simplicity and hope to share the things I learn or any thoughts that relate to software engineering.

The technologies I used:
- Github Pages for hosting
- Jekyll and jekyll-theme-console as the engine to display those static pages
- GoDaddy to register the .dev domain (Google Domains is not yet available for the Polish market)

Github Pages provides TLS certificates for the domain you specify so I didn't have to set it up myself. I also didn't have to set-up an HTTP server to serve my blog content, Github Pages takes care of it.
