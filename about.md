# about

Hi, my name is Dariusz JÄ™drzejczyk. I enjoy writing code and I am currently building an internal PaaS at [allegro.pl][allegro-pl].
Some of my blog posts can be found in the [allegro.tech][allegro-tech] community blog.

# other bio
As a husband and father of two I do my best to also find the time to occasionally hike, snowboard and travel.
